- 2020: No time, but Winni and I gave a pair programming presentation using one
  of the problems.
- 2019: Not sure where this code went, it never ended up here for some reason.
  I used Python but didn't have time to complete all problems.

- 2017: Re-learning [D](https://www.dlang.org). 
  Did not finish due to lack of time (again).

  all problems anyawy due to lack of time.
