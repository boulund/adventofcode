# Advent of Code
Toying with some of the problems from AdventOfCode.com

## History
- 2021: Python again.
- 2020: No time, but Winni and I gave a pair programming presentation using one
  of the problems.
- 2019: Not sure where this code went, it never ended up here for some reason.
  I used Python but didn't have time to complete all problems.
- 2018: Python again? We'll see.
- 2017: Re-learning [D](https://www.dlang.org). 
  Did not finish due to lack of time (again).
- 2016: Python, because it's easy. Never put this code
  under version control for some reason. Didn't finish 
  all problems anyawy due to lack of time.
